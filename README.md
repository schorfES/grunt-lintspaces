If you're looking for a [gulpjs](http://gulpjs.com/) task to validate your
files, take a look at this one:

* [gulp-lintspaces](https://github.com/AlbertoElias/gulp-lintspaces)

## Issues & feature requests

This grunt task is just a wrapper for the node module called
[lintspaces](https://github.com/schorfES/node-lintspaces). If you have any
issues or feature requests, please consider if this may belongs to the node
module its self.

## Getting Started
_If you haven't used [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out
the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide._

From the same directory as your project's Gruntfile and package.json, install
this plugin with the following command:

```bash
npm install grunt-lintspaces --save-dev
```

Once that's done, add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-lintspaces');
```

Inside your `grunt.js` file add a section named `lintspaces`. This section
specifies the tasks. Each task takes sources and options as parameters.

## Parameters

### sources ```src```

This sets the path of the files to be checked.

## Options

### newline at end of file option

Tests for newlines at the end of all files. Default value is `false`.

```javascript
	newline: true
```

* returns code ```NEWLINE```, when a missing a newline at the end of the file.
* returns code ```NEWLINE_AMOUNT```, when found unexpected additional newlines
at the end of a file.
* returns type ```warning```

### maximum newlines option

Test for the maximum amount of newlines between code blocks. Default value is
`false`. To enable this validation a number larger than `0` is expected.

```javascript
	newlineMaximum: 2
```

* returns code ```NEWLINE_MAXIMUM```, when maximum amount of newlines exceeded
between code blocks.
* returns type ```warning```

### endOfLine option

Lintspaces fails with incorrect end of line errors when files contain lines that
end in the wrong sequence. Default value is `false`. To enable end of line checks
use any of the following values: `'LF'` or `'CRLF'` or `'CR'`. Values are
case-insensitive. Note that this option checks all lines; even "ignored" lines.

```javascript
    endOfLine: 'lf'
```

* returns code ```END_OF_LINE```, when the wrong line ending sequence is found.
* returns type ```warning```

### trailingspaces option

Tests for useless whitespaces (trailing whitespaces) at each lineending of all
files. Default value is `false`.

```javascript
	trailingspaces: true
```

* returns code ```TRAILINGSPACES```, when unexpected trailing spaces were found.
* returns type ```warning```

**Note:** If you like to to skip empty lines from reporting (for whatever
reason), use the option ```trailingspacesSkipBlanks``` and set them to ```true```.

### indentation options

Tests for correct indentation using tabs or spaces. Default value is `false`.
To enable indentation check use the value `'tabs'` or `'spaces'`.

```javascript
	indentation: 'tabs'
```

* returns code ```INDENTATION_TABS```, when spaces are used instead of tabs.
* returns type ```warning```

If the indentation option is set to `'spaces'`, there is also the possibility
to set the amount of spaces per indentation using the `spaces` option. Default
value is `4`.

```javascript
	indentation: 'spaces',
	spaces: 2
```

* returns code ```INDENTATION_SPACES```, when tabs are used instead of spaces.
* returns code ```INDENTATION_SPACES_AMOUNT```, when spaces are used but the
amound is not as expected.
* returns type ```warning```

### guess indentation option

This ```indentationGuess``` option _tries to guess_ the indention of a line
depending on previous lines. The report of this option can be incorrect,
because the _correct_ indentation depends on the actual programming language
and styleguide of the certain file. The default value is `false` - disabled.

This feature follows the following rules: _The indentation of the current
line is correct when:_

* the amount of indentations is equal to the previous or
* the amount of indentations is less than the previous line or
* the amount of indentations is one more than the previous line
* the amount of indentations is zero and the lines length is also zero which
is an empty line without trailing whitespaces

```javascript
	indentationGuess: true
```

* returns code ```NEWLINE_GUESS```
* returns type ```hint```

### allowsBOM option

Lintspaces fails with incorrect indentation errors when files contain Byte Order
Marks (BOM). If you don't want to give false positives for inconsistent tabs or
spaces, set the ```allowsBOM``` option to ```true```.  The default value is
`false` - disabled.

```javascript
	allowsBOM: true
```

### ignores option

Use the `ignores` option when special lines such as comments should be ignored.
Provide an array of regular expressions to the `ignores` property.

```javascript
	ignores: [
		/\/\*[\s\S]*?\*\//g,
		/foo bar/g
	]
```

There are some _**build in**_ ignores for comments which you can apply by using
these strings:

* 'js-comments'
* 'c-comments'
* 'java-comments'
* 'as-comments'
* 'xml-comments'
* 'html-comments'
* 'python-comments'
* 'ruby-comments'
* 'applescript-comments'

_(build in strings and userdefined regular expressions are mixable in the
`ignores` array)_

```javascript
	ignores: [
		'js-comments',
		/foo bar/g
	]
```

_Feel free to contribute some new regular expressions as build in!_

**Note:** Trailing spaces are not ignored by default, because they are always
evil!! If you still want to ignore them use the ```trailingspacesToIgnores```
option and set them to ```true```.

**Note:** If endOfLine checking is enabled, then all lines (including
"ignored" lines will be checked for appropriate end of line sequences.


### .editorconfig option

It's possible to overwrite the default and given options by setting up a path
to an external editorconfig file by using the `editorconfig` option. For a basic
configuration of a _.editorconfig_ file check out the
[EditorConfig Documentation](http://editorconfig.org/).

```javascript
	editorconfig: '.editorconfig'
```

The following .editorconfig values are supported:

* `insert_final_newline` will check if a newline is set
* `indent_style` will check the indentation
* `indent_size` will check the amount of spaces
* `trim_trailing_whitespace` will check for useless whitespaces
* `end_of_line` will check the end of line character sequence

### .rcconfig option

Load all settings from a RC configuration file. The configuration can be defined
in ```ini``` or ```json``` format. When setting this option to ```true``` the
configuration from a ```.lintspacesrc``` in the
[RC standards load paths](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc#standards)
will be taken.

```javascript
	rcconfig: true
```

Define a custom path to a RC configuration file of your choice by setting the
option to the desired path.

```javascript
	rcconfig: 'path/to/.customrc'
```

### showValid option

This is a specific option related to this task. When active all valid processed
files will be logged. Default value is `false`.

```javascript
	showValid: true
```

### showTypes option

This is a specific option related to this task. By default the type of each
message is shown by the color of the message text. To show at the beginning of
the message set this to `true`. Default value is `false`.

```javascript
	showTypes: true
```

### showCodes option

This is a specific option related to this task. When active all reporting codes
will appear at the end of each message. Default value is `false`.

```javascript
	showCodes: true
```

### junit option

When adding a path as string for the `junit` option, the grunt task will write
a junit xml report to the specified path. Default value is `false` â€“ disabled.

```javascript
	junit: '.grunt/junit-lintspaces.xml'
```

## Configuration Examples

```javascript
lintspaces: {
	all: {
		src: [
			'**/*'
		],
		options: {
			newline: true,
			newlineMaximum: 2,
			trailingspaces: true,
			indentation: 'spaces',
			spaces: 2
		}
	},
	javascript: {
		src: [
			'js/src/**/*.js'
		],
		options: {
			newline: true,
			trailingspaces: true,
			indentation: 'tabs',
			ignores: ['js-comments']
		}
	},
	external: {
		src: [
			'**/*'
		],
		options: {
			editorconfig: '.editorconfig'
		}
	}
}
```
